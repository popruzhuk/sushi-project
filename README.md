Sushi is a multi-page website where I developed the frontend part. The project includes a fully responsive design and various modern features, such as an interactive header, a calendar, and other engaging UI elements. I also implemented Hebrew language support, ensuring accessibility for a wider audience. This project demonstrates my ability to combine clean layout, adaptive design, and dynamic functionality to create a modern user experience.
